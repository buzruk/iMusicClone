enum Helper {
  /// Performs a view animation using a timing curve corresponding to the motion of a physical spring.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - withDuration: The amount of time (measured in seconds)
  ///   to wait beforebeginning the animations.
  ///   Specify a value of 0 to begin the animations immediately.
  ///   - delay: The amount of time (measured in seconds)
  ///   to wait before beginning the animations.
  ///   Specify a value of 0 to begin the animations immediately.
  ///   - usingSpringWithDamping: The damping ratio for the spring animation
  ///   as it approaches its quiescent state.
  ///  To smoothly decelerate the animation without oscillation, use a value
  ///  of 1. Employ a damping ratio closer to zero to increase oscillation.
  ///   - initialSpringVelocity: The initial spring velocity.
  ///   For smooth start to the animation, match this value to the viewâ€™s
  ///   velocity as it was prior to attachment.
  ///  A value of 1 corresponds to the total animation distance traversed
  ///  in one second. For example, if the total animation distance
  ///  is 200 points and you want the start of the animation to match
  ///  a view velocity of 100 pt/s, use a value of 0.5.
  ///   - options: A mask of options indicating how you want
  ///   to perform the animations.
  ///   - animations: A block object to be executed when the animation
  ///   sequence ends. This block has no return value and takes a single
  ///   Boolean argument that indicates whether or not the animations
  ///   actually finished before the completion handler was called.
  ///   If the duration of the animation is 0, this block is performed at
  ///   the beginning of the next run loop cycle. This parameter may be NULL.
